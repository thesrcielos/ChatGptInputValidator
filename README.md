# Java Input Validator

This is a Java library that uses the **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern to validate and clean user input before it is processed (e.g., sent to a language model or backend system). It includes modular validation steps like length checks, spam filtering, useless input detection, and content quality analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed:

- [Java 17+](https://jdk.java.net/)
- [Maven 3.8+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- Git (optional, for cloning)
- An ChatGpt Api Key for this create a .env file and create a variable called API_KEY and paste the key

### API REST
There is one endpoint in this project.

* /api/enhanced/ask?question=<question> this is an endpoint to ask to ChatGpt with input validation.

#### Deployed App
https://chatgptservice-gpbzgkd7anadbhee.westus-01.azurewebsites.net/

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thesrcielos/ChatGptInputValidator
cd ChatGptInputValidator
```

### Build the project using Maven:
```
mvn clean install
```

### Running the Application
This is a library, so you include it as a dependency or run usage examples via your own entry point.

Example usage:

```
InputValidator validator = new InputValidator();
ValidationResult result = validator.validateInput("Hello, how are you doing today?");
if (result.isValid()) {
    System.out.println("Cleaned input: " + result.getCleanedInput());
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid: " + result.getReason());
}
```

## Chain of Responsibility Pattern in the Input Validator Code

This code implements the **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern to create a modular and extensible input validation system.

### üîó What is Chain of Responsibility?

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an input to be passed through a sequence of handlers, where each handler performs a specific check or processing step. Each handler can decide to:
- Pass the input to the **next handler** in the chain, or
- **Stop** the chain and return a validation error.

### üß± How It's Used in the Code

- Each validation rule is implemented as a subclass of the abstract `ValidationHandler`.
- Handlers are linked using the `setNext()` method to form a chain.
- The `handle()` method processes the input step-by-step through this chain.

### üõ†Ô∏è Benefits of This Approach

- **Modularity**: Each validation is isolated in its own class.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add, remove, or reorder validation steps.
- **Reusability**: Different chains can be created for different use cases (e.g., strict, lenient, custom).
- **Maintainability**: New rules can be added without changing the core logic.

### ‚úÖ Example

A typical validation chain might look like:

```
nullHandler
    .setNext(cleaningHandler)
    .setNext(lengthHandler)
    .setNext(contentHandler)
    .setNext(spamHandler)
    .setNext(uselessHandler)
    .setNext(qualityHandler)
    .setNext(tokenHandler);

```

## Design
This project follows the Chain of Responsibility design pattern.

Each validation step is implemented as a separate handler class:

    NullValidationHandler

    InputCleaningHandler

    LengthValidationHandler

    ContentPatternValidationHandler

    SpamValidationHandler

    UselessInputValidationHandler

    ContentQualityValidationHandler

A builder is provided to compose validation chains programmatically.

### Example Configurations
```
InputValidator strictValidator = InputValidator.createStrict();
InputValidator lenientValidator = InputValidator.createLenient();
```
Or use a custom builder:
```
InputValidator custom = InputValidator.builder()
    .addNullValidation()
    .addInputCleaning()
    .addLengthValidation(5, 1000)
    .addSpamValidation(5)
    .addContentQualityValidation(0.4)
    .build();
```
